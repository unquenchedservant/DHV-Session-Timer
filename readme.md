# DHV Session Timer
A quick QT based timer, with a ding at adjustable intervals. Useful for reminding yourself to 
adjust the temperature on your Dry Herb Vape session.

This is built using the Solo 3 in mind, and so time and temperature limits are because of that. 

## Installation
Should work on most versions of Python 3, but was built with Python 3.13

The following dependencies are needed:
- playsound
- pyqt5

Once installed, you should be able to run the python file. 

## Defaults
### Temp
All temperatures are fahrenheit, until a future update

Start temp: 350 
2nd temp:   375
3rd temp:   400

### Time
1st adjustment:  6 minutes
2nd adjustment:  8 minutes
Session end:    10 minutes
