"""
This application is a timer for a Dry-Herb vape with a session. It has 3 temperature settings and 3 time settings.
It will remind you to increase the temperature at the specified times, and will notify you when the session is complete.
It was designed with the Arizer Solo 3 in mind, but can be used with most other session vapes.
